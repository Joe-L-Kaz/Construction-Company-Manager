# Construction-Company-Manager
This was just a small project for learning purposes, I wanted to learn how to make more interactive apps with a user interface and store information into a data base, and then be able to retrieve this information and disaplay it to the user.
Simple form of user-authentication is also present, however the database is on my local machine, so trying to run it on another will not work. However I did learn a a little bit about user interfaces and the MVVM design pattern.
